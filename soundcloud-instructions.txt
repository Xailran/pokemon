Implement the Soundcloud API into our Pokemon app so that people can listen
to music while they're playing! Navigate to the JavaScript SDK docs (https://developers.soundcloud.
com/docs/api/sdks).

We should have a text box that allows the users to search for tracks that they want to play.

Display information about the music currently playing.

Bonus: Convert the Pokemon website to a Django project! Then, instead of using the JavaScript implementation of the Soundcloud API, we can use the server side implementation.

Double Bonus: Look at the Spotify API and implement the ability to search for songs via voice control! (the docs are found here: https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/)
